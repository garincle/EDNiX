EasyMRIbrain
=======

EasyMRIbrain enables a flexible analysis of MRI images of different mammlian species (anatomical, fMRI, and more soon!), PET, from raw data to statstical analysis. EasyMRIbrain has been design to adapt to the various constrain of each species as well as to the different tools used in laboratories.
This pipeline may not cover all issues encounter during processing, but has been test on the largest sample of species possible so far. Any issues encounter during processing can be reported in the issues section to improve the flexibility of this pipeline.
EasyMRIbrain also for longitudinal co-coregistration (when a individual is scanned multiple time). Signal extration can rely on a library of cross-species atlases, provided along with the pipeline.
